The purpose of this script is to provide an easy way to run an exported Excel macro (bas) on any excel file - this makes it easy to schedule the file for automation. This is a VBS script that should work with most versions of windows, requirements for doing this:

1) Windows 7 tested (never tried VBS in other environments so beware!)
2) Have Excel (Office 2007 +) installed
3) Have VBA access for scripts allowed in Trust center settings of excel.

Once this script is setup to your environment, you can schedule it or just double click the script icon to launch it.

Included here is the general VBS file and no BAS, but will soon upload paired VBS/BAS files for more concrete examples of how to modify this to meet your needs.

I recommend reading all of the comments in the "general_vbs_macro_script.vbs" file as they give tips on how to customize this for your needs.
